# Minecraft Litematica Schematics
This repository contains a variety of Litematica Schematics I've saved over the years.  Most of the schematics have been created by myself, while others are schematics as created by other authors, saved just in case they get lost over time.

As of the current version, there are some schematics which I still need to clean up, i.e., terrain and extra elements which do not need to be there to be build.  Over time I hope to clean these up.

## Usage
Use git to get the schematics, or pick a schematic from the repository and download it.  Currently I do not have any packages, but will try to set this up for easier ways to download.

Once you have the schematics, place them in the schematics directory as set up in your litematica config (this should be under customSchematicBaseDirectory).  After you've done this, open up Minecraft and load the schematics using Litematica.
